									<strong>Brass tacks:</strong> <em class="post-sidenote">Demos; <a href="">Style 01</a>, <a href="">Style 02</a>, <a href="">Style 03</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/html5forms/tree/master/errorStyles">the code</a>.</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong class="dropCap">I</strong>f you haven't heard already, the current HTML Living Standard or HTML5 spec has in it some super cool form validation. This is client-side form validation that is meant to remove some of the burden of writing validation with Javascript. If you've ever written form validation with Javascript I think you'll agree that this is a very good thing. 
								</p>
<p>
	Using this new feature of html can be as easy as creating a form and within it creating an input with a <code>required</code> attribute. When the form is submitted, browsers that support validation will take the reigns and make sure that the required input has a value. If it does not, the browser will display a validation error message.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to validating required fields, the form validation will also check to make sure inputted values match given input types. New in the Living Standard are quite a few new input types such as; "email", "url", "number" and so on. Check out the full list located at <a href="http://developers.whatwg.org/the-input-element.html#the-input-element">http://developers.whatwg.org/the-input-element.html#the-input-element</a>. 
</p>
<h5>Validation error messages</h5>
<p>
	As of this writing, there are three browsers that both support html form validation and display a error messages when needed. Browser support includes; Chrome 10+, Firefox 3.6+, and Opera 11+. Safari doesn't care about validating your forms. Each browser handles the styling of validation messages differently.
	<img class="figure" src='/storage/post_image_htmlFormErrors_defaultChrome.jpg' alt='Chrome 12 default error messages' />
	<em class="figcaption">Chrome 12 default error message</em>
	<img class="figure" src='/storage/post_image_htmlFormErrors_defaultFirefox.jpg' alt='Firefox 5.0 default error messages' />
	<em class="figcaption">Firefox 5.0 default error message</em>
	<img class="figure" src='/storage/post_image_htmlFormErrors_defaultOpera.jpg' alt='Opera 11.5 default error messages' />
	<em class="figcaption">Opera 11.5 default error message</em>
</p>
<p>
	Of the three, only Chrome currently offers a way to apply custom styles to the message. Through non-standard, Webkit-specific pseudo classes you are able to style the messages in any way that floats your boat. That's what I'm focusing on with this article.
</p>
<h5>What about the other browsers?</h5>
<p>
	That's a good question. I haven't heard anything about Opera, but it seems that the style and even handling of the error messages is an open discussion with Firefox. I did quite a bit of digging around in <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> and in the FF 5 source code, but couldn't find any solid information on what the plan is. My hope is that a standard will emerge for styling the messages, but that could be far off.
</p>
<h5>The pseudo classes and markup</h5>
<p>
	When I first started looking into if/how the error messages could be styled I quickly came across a "Rosetta Stone" in an article by Peter Gasston, <a href="http://www.broken-links.com/2011/06/16/styling-html5-form-validation-errors/">http://www.broken-links.com/2011/06/16/styling-html5-form-validation-errors</a>. In the post Peter explains the pseudo classes that webkit makes available to target the error message elements. He's done the leg work of digging through the Webkit source code to find this stuff, thanks Peter! To reiterate some of what is in Peter's article, the following are the classes that are available to hook into:
</p>
<pre><code>::-webkit-validation-bubble {}
::-webkit-validation-bubble-message {}
::-webkit-validation-bubble-arrow {}
::-webkit-validation-bubble-arrow-clipper {}</code></pre>
<p>
	Each of those target a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element that is inserted into the DOM when a validation error is triggered. The markup looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div -webkit-validation-bubble&gt;
    &lt;div -webkit-validation-bubble-arrow&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div -webkit-validation-bubble-arrow-clipper&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div -webkit-validation-bubble-message&gt;Error Message&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<h5>Default styles</h5>
<p>
	A huge help when styling the messages is knowing the default styles that Chrome applies. Luckily the default Webkit CSS is available to peruse so you can see the exact properties that need to be modified. The default styles live here; <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css?rev=82180#L588">http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css?rev=82180#L588</a>
</p>
<h5>Demos</h5>
<p>
	I set up three different demos using markup for a simple login form containing two fields. The first field is an email input that is required:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input type="email" name="email" required&gt;</pre></code>
<p>
	The second field is a password input that is required:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input type="password" name="password" required&gt;</pre></code>
<p>
	The rest of the markup for each demo is nearly identical, differences include; using <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements for the first demo and some different structural elements for each.
</p>
<p>
	To really work with the message styles, I wanted each demo to have a distinct style from the others. Demo 1 has a kind of standard-looking style with error messages that are big, bright and bubbly. Demo 2 has a sleeker, higher-tech, control panel-y look with a slimmed down error icon with no text. Demo 3 has an artsy, Draplin-inspired, Futura-filled look that carries over into big-ole, text only error messages.

	<em class="figcaption">Style 03; hard to go wrong with fire engine-red Futura</em>
</p>
<h5>More fun stuff</h5>
<p>
	Something to remember when styling the messages is that most any styles that are available in Chrome can be applied to the message bubbles, this includes animations. With demos 1 and 2 I created created CSS animations to bring the messages into view. Since the message elements do not exist in the DOM until an error is triggered, the animations will not run until that time. So, in demo 1, to get that little shimmy and shake I'm using the following:
</p>
<pre><code>@-webkit-keyframes bounce {
    0% {
        opacity: 0.5;
        margin-left: 85px;
    }
	
    25% {
        margin-left: -35px;
    }
	
    50% {
        margin-left: 50px;
    }
	
    75% {
        margin-left: -22px;
    }
	
    100% {
        margin-left: -15px;
        opacity: 0.9;
    }
}</pre></code>
<p>
	The named animation is applied to the main message container;
</p>
<pre><code>::-webkit-validation-bubble {
    -webkit-animation-timing-function: ease;
    -webkit-animation: bounce 0.45s 1;
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>
	Demo 2 uses a similar, but less complex animation to slide the serious looking icon in from the left.
</p>

							<div class="tumblr-post-content">
								<p class="post-intro">
									<strong>Take aways:</strong> <em class="post-sidenote">Look at <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/jribbble/">this site</a> and fork <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/jribbble.com">this code</a> if you don't feel like reading.</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong class='dropCap'>S</strong>ince reading <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a> by Ethan Marcotte I've been chomping at the bit to design a site using all of the fancy things written about in that little, yellow, different book. To really take those new ideas and techniques for a ride I needed a small project to work on where I could just go crazy and try every new thing I could pull out of the book and my brain. Luckily I have a never-ending stream of personal projects that can always use a little TLC. The project that I picked to revamp is a small one page site for a jQuery plugin that I wrote last year, Jribbble. The site is quick overview of the methods that the plugin makes available, documentation of those methods and some working demos.
								</p>
								<h5>The design process</h5>
								<p>
									Before starting a design I like to set some rules for myself. These aren't hard and fast rules, just some general thoughts that I keep in mind to guide the process and keep myself in check. The rules for this design were nothing outlandish, the design should:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Use a flexible grid that remains comfortable from 320px to 1280px in width</li>
									<li>Be designed mostly in the browser with CSS, limited Photoshop work</li>
									<li>Not use any gradients</li>
									<li>Not use any Photoshop noise!</li>
									<li>Have some bits of CSS "sugar"</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									The last rule, "sugar", I think of as something extra, something possibly new, that you might not see that often. I'll talk about it more later.
								</p>
								<p>
									The first graphic I envisioned for the design was the name, Jribbble. I saw the "J" and the "b"s in a large, swooping style. A style that I would not be able to accomplish with a computer. I would need to use my hands. The vision I had for it was too large for a pencil or pen or marker. I grabbed my box of acrylic paints, brushes, my 14" x 17" drawing pad and spread them out on my definitely-not-for-painting-on Ikea coffee table. With a medium sized brush and Primary Magenta I scrawled out a couple of "Jribbble"s as well as some random strokes. The toothbrush you see in the photo I used for making paint spatters and for getting paint all over the damned place.
									<img class="figure" src='http://tylergaw.com/storage/post_image_jribbble_painting.jpg' alt='Jribbble painting' />
								</p>
								<p>
									After the painting I took the "Jribbble" I liked most into Photoshop and fiddled with it a bit. I isolated the color from the background, applied the Twirl filter a few times to give it more character and added some of the random strokes and splatters around it for a more haphazard look. In Photoshop I set up a 958px, 12 column grid to work off of. For the banner and assorted page headers I selected <a href="http://typekit.com/fonts/botanika-mono-web">Botanika Mono Web from Typekit</a>. I don't own that font so I have to use a very advanced and elegant method for playing around with initial type layout. I input the text I need into Typekit's Type Tester and take screenshots of the text from there. See, fancy ain't it?
									<img class="figure" src='http://tylergaw.com/storage/post_image_jribbble_design.jpg' alt='Jribbble design' />
								</p>
								<p>
									The image above is the extent of the design accomplished with Photoshop. From that point on the rest of the design was created with good ole' CSS. Just like I have always done in Photoshop I went through quite a few style iterations; colors, type sizes, positioning, but instead of spending that time in Photoshop and only moving to the browser when it was "final" I used the medium that would be delivered to create the design. Designing in the browser, it feels good man.
								</p>
								<h5>The Flexibility</h5>
								<p>
									To accomplish my flexible grid, I started with a overall width of 80% on the content area. That number was somewhat arbitrary, I started with 100% and decreased the number until I felt there was a comfortable amount of room between the edge of the browser and the beginning of the content. I am setting a <code>max-width</code> of 1280px on the content area. Any wider than that and things started to get a little unwieldy; line-lengths were too long and in general things just didn't look good. At browser widths of 768px or narrower I wanted to gain back some of the margin so I used a media query to increase the width to 95%.
								</p>
								<pre><code>#content {
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 1280px;
    width: 80%;

    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
        width: 95%;
    }
}</code></pre>
								<p>
									<em class='post-sidenote'>Quick note on the media query. I'm using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> which allows for nested styles. You'll see more of this in later code examples.</em>
								</p>
								<p>
									In a number of areas of the design I use a two-column layout. To determine the widths of each column I used the oh-so-helpful formula that Ethan describes in <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr>: <br />
								</p>
								<pre><code>target &divide; context = result</code></pre>
								<p>
									For the columns I use the starting width of 958px as a context then determine a pixel value based off the width of each of my grid columns, 69px, to come up with widths like:
								</p>
								<pre><code>.method-description {
    h3 {
        float: left;
        width: 40.1878914%; /* 385 &divide; 958 = .401878914 */
        ...
    }

    p {
        float: right;
        ...
        width: 56.4718163%; /* 541 &divide; 958 = .564718163 */
    }
}</code></pre>
								<h5>More on media queries</h5>
								<p>
									Throughout the design I used media queries to add more fine tuning of styles that I couldn't accomplish with percentages alone. I decrease font sizes, switch to single column layouts and make other miscellaneous tweaks as the browser width decreases or increases to specified break points. For cross browser media query support I used the <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">Respond.js</a> poly fill. It works great, media queries in IE7, you can't beat that with a stick! I needed to make some specific enhancements based on features as well so I used <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizer</a> for feature detection. I included Respond.js in my Modernizer build.
								</p>
								<h5>The Good Stuff, The Sweetness, <i>The Sugar</i></h5>
								<p>
									How does a die-cut, scaleable background image sound? I thought it sounded pretty rad. I'll explain. I had the idea that I wanted the "Jribbble" graphic to be different colors at different times. One way to accomplish that would have been to make a number of different images in the various colors that I wanted. That would work, but I thought I could do it a more efficient way. What I did was create an image that had a set background color of <code>#ececec</code> with the text itself transparent allowing for a background color to show through.
									<img class="figure" src='http://tylergaw.com/storage/post_image_jribbble_transparent.jpg' alt='Jribbble background image' />
								</p>
								<p>
									With die-cut taken care of, let's look at scaleable. At its base size of 1149px by 663px the logo graphic is pretty large. At medium to large browser widths, this works fine, as the browser width decreases or increases the graphic starts to lose its intended effect and also starts to cause readability issues for other page elements. <code>background-size</code> to the rescue!
								</p>
								<pre><code>#bigAssJribbble {
    background-image: url(../images/branding-die-cut.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: 15% 100%;
    -moz-background-size: 190% 140%;
    -webkit-background-size: 190% 140%;
    -o-background-size: 190% 140%;
    background-size: 190% 140%;
    padding-top: 45%;
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
}</code></pre>
								<p>
									A couple things are going on here. It's important to note that the branding-die-cut.png image is much wider than it needs to be. The graphic is flush left and the right side extends ~1049px and is filled with our background color <code>#ececec</code>. I do this so I am able to position the background image off the left side of the browser and not leave a gap on the right side. If there was a gap that the image didn't cover, any background color would show through where I didn't want. The width of the element is set to 100% so it is always the size of the browser. The <code>background-size</code> property does exactly what it says, it scales the background image to the percentages that I used. There isn't a science to those numbers, I just tweaked them until they looked right. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Another cool thing in that block of CSS is the <code>padding-top</code>. Since an element has to be taller than 0px for a background image to show and I didn't want to set an explicit height due to the changing graphic size I used the percentage padding to give the element a height. Again, no science with that number, just changed it until it worked.
								</p>
								<p>
									Something that's not accounted for in the above CSS is the background color, the color that should show through the die-cut image. This is where I started having a lot of fun. I set up 11 media queries at different pixel max-widths from 320px to 2360px, at each of those I set a different background color for the logo as well as a number of different elements on the page. As the browser width increases or decreases the background color changes. Another little extra I use is a CSS transition to smoothly change from one color to another on each of the chameleon-like elements. An example element with a media query colorway:
								</p>
								<pre><code>#bigAssJribbble {
    -moz-transition: background-color 0.2s;	
    -webkit-transition: background-color 0.2s;
    -o-transition: background-color 0.2s;
    transition: background-color 0.2s;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
    #bigAssJribbble {
        background-color: #4400ff;
    }
}</code></pre>
								<p>
									I didn't get incredibly specific with what colors I chose. I started with a base of <code>#ff0066</code> and then apply cooler colors as the width decreases and warmer as it increases.
								</p>
								<p>
									That's CSS sugar in my view. It's not something that everyone will see, but it's just a little extra for those that are looking and into that sort of thing.
								</p>
								<h5>That's all</h5>
								<p>
									All in all a very fun process full of experimentation and learning for the sake of experimentation and learning. It probably took too long, so it goes. Side projects live in the off hours, the small windows of time before and after the "real" work and in the hours when you probably need to be sleeping.
								</p>

							<div class="tumblr-post-content">
								<p><strong class='dropCap'>I</strong> am not a fan of the Die IE6 Campaigns, can't get behind them. You will not see me sporting some goofy <a href='http://twibbon.com/join/IE6-Must-Die' rel='external'>IE6 Must Die Twibbon</a> any time soon. I take a pretty unpopular position on IE6; I do not mind developing for IE6, working with it over the past few years has made me a better, smarter developer and I am going to miss it a bit when It's completely out of the picture. Whoa, look out, you're probably thinking I'm bat-shit crazy by now, but hear me out. I have reasons.</p><p><strong>1. It pushes you to write proper, lightweight HTML markup: </strong>IE6 has well-known issues with the box model, strange padding and margin issue, etc. One very good way to stop these potential CSS issues is to write good markup. Easy things like making sure you are writing semantic, valid markup and using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags sparingly can knock out probably 95% of these issues that seem to be such a problem for so many. In my experience, most folks' CSS issues aren't CSS issues at all, they are HTML issues.</p><p><strong>2. It gives you yet another chance to get creative: </strong>So what if IE6 doesn't support transparent pngs. Find a way to make that image a transparent gif or a jpg. Doesn't look as crisp as the png? So what, this is where progressive enhancement steps in, this is why we have conditional comments. Set up an IE6 stylesheet and dump all of the not so desirable CSS in there. Chances are most of your users are not on IE6 anyway, and if they are this can be a friendly little jab at them for using it. I took this route when building my site. I wanted to let anyone viewing my site with The 6 know that they are missing out so I created a completely stripped down version just for IE6, plus a nice reminder of why. It still works, you can access all the same content, it's just not pretty.</p><p class='tumblr-post-image-section'><a href='http://www.tylergaw.com/storage/post_image_tgawie6_full.jpg' class='thickbox' title='tylergaw.com IE6 Screenshot'><img src='http://www.tylergaw.com/storage/post_image_tgawie6_thumb.jpg' alt='tylergaw.com IE6 Screenshot' /></a></p><p><strong>3. It forces you to clean up sloppy code that other browsers ignore: </strong>I've seen this a number of times when writing Javascript. Take a look at this bit of JS:</p><p class='tumblr-post-code-block'><code>var someCrud = ['item01', 'item02', 'item03',];<br />alert(someCrud.length);</code></p><p>What's the length of the array? Firefox and Safari say 3. IE6 says 4. I'm siding with The 6 on this one, the comma at the end of the array is erroneous, it should not be there. IE6 sends the message that you should clean up your code by recognizing the extra item while the more advanced browsers ignore it and let you go on your sloppy way. This is just one example, I've come across a number of similar examples over the years, I'm sure others have too.</p><p><strong>4. It keeps you on your toes: </strong>If you're building websites you need to be flexible. Not all environments are going to be picture perfect, and knowing how to find solutions to problems that arise when working with a browser like The 6 is key. It's easy to just say that a browser is the sole reason for not getting something to function well. Another look at it may reveal that the first approach taken was maybe not the best. You just have to put on that thinking cap a bit.</p><p><strong>5. It's good to have a nemesis: </strong>What good is Batman without the Joker? You have to have someone or something that challenges you and makes your job harder, and sometimes downright frustrating. Web development is hard, that's why it's fun. How good a feeling is it to confront a problem in development and find some interesting way around it? I got a whole crappy article out of doing just that.</p><p>This viewpoint is 100% from that of a developer. As a user, I agree using IE6 would just be a nightmare. The security issues, the lack of features that modern browsers have, etc., etc. That is one merit that the Die IE6 campaigns have. But every time I see some Johnny Developer complaining about how hard it is to build websites for IE6 and how much they hate it, I can't help but think that that person is missing out on opportunities to use their noggin. And that they are a bit of a wimp. :)</p><p>After IE6 is gone some other browser will take it's place as the whipping boy. IE7? So, instead of just joining a campaign of wishing death on an inanimate object, I say learn to take away as much knowledge as you can from a less-than-ideal situation.

								<p><strong class='dropCap'>I</strong> slapped a fresh coat on the old website. Well, new paint, siding, frame, foundation...who am I kidding? I just burned down the old one and built anew on its smoldering ashes.</p><p>This is the third incarnation of tylergaw.com and just like the past two versions, I've had a damn good time working on this one. I've been able to take the time to work with so much amazing code that I've never really dug into before. This is the first full site I've built using the <a href='http://framework.zend.com/'>Zend Framework</a> which has just made me realize how completely rad it is working with a rock-solid framework. It also makes me kick myself a little for not picking it up a long time ago. I'm integrating with a number of different third party APIs, this is also the first time I've built a site doing that. How freaking cool is working with well-written, well-documented APIs?<p><p>With the visual design, I've really tried to push it in a direction that I think is, "me". This was one of those designs that I could really see in my head before I opened Photoshop or even put one thing down on paper. The biggest inspiration came from the cover art for <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_%28novel%29'>Charles Bukowski's Women</a>. The whole time I was reading the book, I was constantly looking back at the cover. I don't know exactly what it is but it is just so damned cool. For this round, I started the design process the old fashioned way; I grabbed a six-pack, some colored pencils, a big-ass sketch book and then went to work.</p><p class='tumblr-post-image-section'><a href='http://tylergaw.com/storage/post_image_women_full.jpg' class='thickbox' rel='post-changes-gallery' title='Design inspiration'><img src='/storage/post_image_women.jpg' alt='Bukowski - Women' /></a><a href='http://tylergaw.com/storage/post_image_tgaw2009sketch_full.jpg' class='thickbox' rel='post-changes-gallery' title='First sketch of tylergaw.com 2009'><img src='/storage/post_image_tgaw2009sketch.jpg' alt='tgaw2009 Sketch' /></a></p><p>I'm a big fan of organic textures and knew that I wanted to incorporate some into the design. When I sat down in Photoshop to start turning my sketch into a working design, I realized quickly that I was going to need some real-world help getting the organic look and feel that I was going for. When it's time for real-world textures I just start grabbing <a href='http://tylergaw.com/storage/post_image_art01.jpg' class='thickbox'>anything</a>, and I mean <a href='http://tylergaw.com/storage/post_image_samich.jpg' class='thickbox'>anything</a>, and throw it on the scanner. You never know what you might use that scan of an old broken toothbrush for. Just to be sure, scan it!</p>
