Small personal site that will house the occasional blog post on topics related to the work I do on the web. Might even write a post or two about getting drunk and starting fights.

### Technologies
* I'm using [Nginx](http://nginx.org). I dig it, it's great.
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org) for super sexy, super organized CSS
* [Typekit](http://typekit.com). Using [Chaparral Pro](http://typekit.com/fonts/chaparral-pro) for my body copy and [Atrament Web](http://typekit.com/fonts/atrament-web) for nav links and headings

### Hosting
Everything will live on a fantastic 256 MB Slice at [Slicehost](http://www.slicehost.com). Which I am acting as sys admin for, so most likely things are going to totally shit the bed at some point in the near future.
