        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Howdy folks, I’m a Web Designer. By that I mean I think, sketch, wireframe, use Photoshop, and write HTML, CSS and Javascript to help create web applications that make peoples’ time on the web easier and hopefully more enjoyable. I'm a part of the badass team at <a href="http://arc90.com">Arc90</a>. Park Slope, Brooklyn is where I call home.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m grateful every day to be able to say that I love what I do. Working as a Designer and Developer means every day is an opportunity to learn something new. And not only is it an option, it's encouraged by the people I work with and the web community as a whole.
        </p>

          Outside of web design, I'm proud to say that I'm a Skateboarder. I've been riding a skateboard consistently for 14 years. It’s the hardest, most frustrating and most rewarding thing I have ever done. When I first picked up a board when I was twelve years old it gave me fresh eyes to see and hear the world. My life would be profoundly different without it.

        <h1>About This Site</h1>
        <p>
          Like millions of other people, this is my little corner of the internet where I share what I'm doing with my work and my life. Designing for yourself is a battle. The current incarnation of this site has taken much longer and gone through a higher number and more drastic revisions than any previous version. I designed and built two other designs close to completion before finally feeling like the aesthetic matched me and my current taste and style.

          No CMS was harmed during the making of this site. I decided early on that it just wasn't necessary. Instead all of the pages of my site are good ole' HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm using SSIs for the common elements of each page; the banner and main footer. For a web server I decided to give <a href="http://nginx.org">NGINX</a> a go. I'm a fan. I find configuration to be much more straight-forward than Apache, and it just feels lighter and faster.

          The fonts are coming from the fantastic Typekit. The headings are set in <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/inconsolata">Inconsolata</a> and that sweet serif is none other than <a href="http://typekit.com/fonts/chaparral-pro">Chaparral Pro</a>.
