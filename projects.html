            <h3>Brooklyn Alpha</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="https://twitter.com/xiian">Tom Sartain</a> and I were having a conversation one night after work. Between the two of us we figured we had approximately zero knowledge about organizing a conference. So, obviously we decided it best to jump right in. This three-day build-a-thon held in Gowanas, Brooklyn was what we came up with.

            <h3>The Man From Hollywood</h3>
            <p>
              Would it be possible to create a kinetic type animation using only CSS transitions and a whole lot of elbow grease? I thought so. TMFH is a first-of-its kind demo of how far CSS animation can be taken.

            <h3>Jribbble</h3>
            <p>
              When a popular web service releases a public API it's like a dinner bell ringing for web developers. We run towards it cooking up ideas of how that beautiful open data can be used. Jribbble was my reaction to Dribbble.com releasing their API. It's a jQuery plugin to easily access shot and player information.

            <p>
              I wanted a way to get an at-a-glance view of all the latest and greatest design snapshots from the design-a-thon that is Dribbble.com. This weekend project of mine continues to be a source of design inspiration for me and the handful of other design lovers that frequent it.

                    <h3>CSS Shaky Animation</h3>
                </a>
                <p>
                    I've always loved the shaky animation style of a lot of cartoons. This demo brings that style to the browser with some CSS tricks and a little elbow grease.

                </a>
                <p>
                    Handwritten text being drawn onto the screen is a common effect in motion graphics. In this demo I recreate that effect using web technologies.

                    Wait, did I just recreate animated gifs using only CSS animations? I sure as hell did. Might not be the most practical thing, but it sure is cool!
