<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>
    I believe my imagination and skills can be used to improve the quality of life
    of others. With that in mind, I am here to build and help others build things
    that are useful, helpful, enjoyable, and thought-provoking. I want to show
    others that they have an endless capacity for creative thinking.
</p>
<p>
    I believe that there is too much mediocrity on the Web. I think we can do better
    and I’m going to try my hardest to do so.
</p>
<p>
    I want to help people see that they have the ability to do things their own way.
    There are no set rules for how they should think or how they approach their
    work, business, career, or life.
</p>

<p>
    I’m not aiming to be the best or the most. I just want to continually produce
    excellent work.
</p>
<p>
    I want to show that making things beautiful and making
    them usable are not mutually exclusive.
</p>
<p>
    I push myself in my work because I believe we can always do better.
