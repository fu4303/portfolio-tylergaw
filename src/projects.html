            <h2>CSS True Titles</h2>
            <p>
                The opening titles of the show True Detective are incredible.
                I wanted to see if I could create a similar style title
                sequence using CSS.

            <h2>The Man From Hollywood</h2>
            <p>
                Would it be possible to create a kinetic type animation using
                CSS? I thought so. TMFH is a first-of-its kind demo of
                how far CSS animation can be taken.

            <h2>CSS Shaky Animation</h2>
            <p>
                I've always loved the shaky animation style of a lot of cartoons.
                This demo brings that style to the browser with some CSS
                tricks and a little elbow grease.

            <h2>CSS Write-on Text Effect</h2>
            <p>
                Handwritten text being drawn onto the screen is a common
                effect in motion graphics. In this demo I recreate that effect
                using web technologies.

            <p>
                I love drawing goofy things with Paper. I wanted a way to
                put all my drawings on the Web. Papersaver allows me to
                publish directly from the app.

                Branched out and tried something new on this one. I went and
                read one typography book and think I need to make my own hand-drawn
                typeface. This guy!

                Wait, did I just recreate animated gifs using only CSS animations?
                I sure as hell did. Might not be the most practical thing, but
                it sure is cool!
