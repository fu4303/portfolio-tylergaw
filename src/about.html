        <p class="number-one">
            The most important thing to know about me as a designer, developer,
            and human is that <strong>I give a shit</strong> and act accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I care immensely about the type and quality of work I’m putting out into the world.
            It’s important that I believe in the motivations and goals of the projects I work on
            and the people I work for. I have plenty of practical skills and
            experience, but the quality of caring is what makes me a great
            designer and developer.
        </p>


        <!-- <p>
            I always design for an audience (if you’re reading this–tag–you’re it)
            and they are on my mind during the entire design process. My goal is not
            always to give the people what they want. Sometimes it is. Sometimes I want
            to challenge them. Sometimes I want to push them to behave in a certain way,
            to learn something new or to forget something old. Sometimes I want to make
            people laugh. Sometimes I want them to focus other times I’m trying to <a href="">distract</a>.

                <h3>On Design</h3>
                <p id="design-definition">
                    It’s hard to say you’re a Designer these days without putting a word in front of it.
                    I may not have held the titles, but I practice; Product, Web, Graphic, UX, UI,
                    and Interaction design. The lines between each are
                    blurry. For each project they may happen on their own, all at once, or not at all.
                    I take a people-first approach to them all. I make every design
                    decision thinking about how it will effect the human
                    that it’s for.

                <h3>On Developement</h3>
                <p>
                    Programming is a means to an end. I have ideas and I want
                    to see them come to life. I use code to make those
                    ideas reality. That doesn’t mean that I approach programming
                    as a craft with any less enthusiasm or care as design.

                    I push myself to learn new languages, frameworks, and practices.
                    No language is off limits and I don’t shy away from learning
                    difficult concepts. Development technologies are in constant flux
                    and I love it.

    <div class="design-to-me">
        Design to me is about influencing human behavior. I use my skills to encourage,
        engage, entertain, entangle, envelop, and enrage.

    <h2>What can I do for you?</h2>
    <p>
        I can design and build incredibly high-quality web sites/apps for you.
        I’m most skilled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I know those like the
        back of my hand and have made great things with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the server-side, I’ve built sites and apps using Node.js, PHP and Ruby on Rails.
        I know enough Python and Django to be dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can design iPhone and iPad apps. I’m an iOS user and enjoy designing
        apps that follow the best practices and patterns put forth by Apple while
        bending and breaking those practices to create unexpectedly delightful details.

        <dt>The ones I’ll take the Pepsi Challenge with</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Design. See <a href="#design-definition">above</a></li>
                <li>HTML. Accessibility and semantics are as important today as ever.</li>
                <li>CSS. I prefer the Sass preprocessor and I like to push boundaries.</li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript. Was writing it before jQuery.
                    I put unobtrusiveness before cleverness. I’ve wielded Backbone.
                    Compiled with RequireJS. I love Underscore. I have more
                    to learn than I have learned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thinkin’ & tinkerin’. I sketch, draw, and doodle. I make
                    collages. I spend a ton of time in my head dreaming
                    about all the things that are possible.

        <dt>The ones I know more than enough about to be dangerous</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Node.js. I’m still blown away it exists. Been building
                    with it since ~0.4. I’m cool with callbacks. Love it
                    because I love JavaScript. Will use it for odd
                    <a href="http://tylergaw.com/articles/papersaver">hacks</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    PHP. The first programming language I learned. I used
                    it non-stop for about three years and spent a good amount
                    of time with the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>.
                    I will break this out any time I need to get something done
                    quick, fast, and in hurry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ruby/Rails. This is my newest acquisition. I said “yes” to a
                    project that required it so I did what any good developer does;
                    spent three days with my nose in a book to learn it.
                    It’s a fun language/framework I look forward to using it more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Python. Worked with Django for a couple years on Readability.
                    Adore it’s syntax and packages. Will use it to <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/timebomb">build tools</a>
                    to aid in laziness.

        I staked my claim on this piece of Internet property in 2006. Since then
        I’ve maintained this site as my portfolio and blog. You can access the source

        If you’re interested in that sort of thing.

        This is the fifth iteration. Below are the previous versions.
        They are a testament to how much I’ve grown personally and how high the
        bar has been raised for quality in Web Design.
