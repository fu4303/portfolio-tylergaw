    <h2>I’m a Designer</h2>
    <p>
        The number one most important thing to know about me as a designer: <strong>I give a shit</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Caring about what I’m designing–and more importantly the people that are
        going to use what I’m designing–is what makes me an great designer.
        I always design for an audience (if you’re reading this–tag–you’re it)
        and they are on my mind during the entire design process. My goal is not
        always to give the people what they want. Sometimes it is. Sometimes I want
        to challenge them. Sometimes I want to push them to behave in a certain way,
        to learn something new or to forget something old. Sometimes I want to make
        people laugh. Sometimes I want them to focus other times I’m trying to <a href="">distract</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="design-to-me">
        Design to me is about influencing human behavior. I use my skills to encourage,
        engage, entice, entertain, entangle, envelop, and enrage.
    </p>
    <p id="design-definition">
        It’s hard to call yourself a Designer these days without qualifying it.
        I may not have held all of these official titles, but I have done and do
        the following types of design: Product, Web, Graphic, UX, UI, Interaction, Motion,
        and some others that I forget. None of those are distinct silos. The lines
        between each are blurry and they can happen indepently or all at once.
    </p>
    <h3>Quality Under Pressure</h3>
    <p>
        It’s paramount to get designed work out into the world. Deadlines are real,
        things need to be done yesterday. However, there is always time enough to
        pay attention to the details and push to make quality products. There will
        always be things that don’t quite get to the level we want, but there is
        never an excuse for entering a project with the mindset of doing the bare
        minimum. I do not and will not do that.
    </p>

    <h2>I’m a Developer</h2>
    <p>
        The number one most important thing to know about me as a developer: <strong>I give a shit</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Early on in my career I realized that there was nearly nothing that could
        not be done on the Web with code. From the beginning I’ve been blown away
        at what can be done with the vast array of tools I have access to as a
        developer. Every time a build something I learn something new regardless
        of the language or project size. I stay curious and open to new languages,
        frameworks, practices. While I have preferences, I do my best to avoid
        attachment to any language or style of writing code.
    </p>
    <h3>What does programming mean to me?</h3>
    <p>
        Learning to program has been a constant reminder that nothing comes easy.
        In my first programming classes I asked questions that made the other
        students’ eyes roll and the instructor to pause in confusion. When I first
        start I understood so little I could hardly misunderstand. Not much has
        changed since then. I’m just familiar with code. Comfortable with code.
        Each language has it’s own sytaxes and indiosycraties, but they all share
        commonalities. I latch on to those. I need those to pull myself into new
        languages and frameworks. Writing code is still magic to me. I hope I never
        know enough to make that untrue.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I’m interested in programming as a craft, my main motivation for
        continuing to develop my skills is to build things. For me code will always
        be a means to an end. I have ideas and I want to see them come to life.
        Code–of all different shapes and sizes–is often needed to make those
        ideas reality.
    </p>

    <h2>What can I do for you?</h2>
    <p>
        I can design and build incredibly high-quality web sites/apps for you.
        I’m most skilled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I know those like the
        back of my hand and have made great things with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the server-side, I’ve built sites and apps using Node.js, PHP and Ruby on Rails.
        I know enough Python and Django to be dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can design iPhone and iPad apps. I’m an iOS user and enjoy designing
        apps that follow the best practices and patterns put forth by Apple while
        bending and breaking those practices to create unexpectedly delightful details.

        <dt>The ones I’ll take the Pepsi Challenge with</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Design. See <a href="#design-definition">above</a></li>
                <li>HTML. Accessibility and semantics are as important today as ever.</li>
                <li>CSS. I prefer the Sass preprocessor and I like to push boundaries.</li>
                <li>
                    JavaScript. Was writing it before jQuery.
                    I put unobtrusiveness before cleverness. I’ve wielded Backbone.
                    Compiled with RequireJS. I love Underscore. I have more
                    to learn than I have learned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thinkin’ & tinkerin’. I sketch, draw, and doodle. I make
                    collages. I spend a ton of time in my head dreaming
                    about all the things that are possible.

        <dt>The ones I know more than enough about to be dangerous</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Node.js. I’m still blown away it exists. Been building
                    with it since ~0.4. I’m cool with callbacks. Love it
                    because I love JavaScript. Will use it for odd
                    <a href="http://tylergaw.com/articles/papersaver">hacks</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    PHP. The first programming language I learned. I used
                    it non-stop for about three years and spent a good amount
                    of time with the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>.
                    I will break this out any time I need to get something done
                    quick, fast, and in hurry.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ruby/Rails. This is my newest acquisition. I said “yes” to a
                    project that required it so I did what any good developer does;
                    spent three days with my nose in a book to learn it.
                    It’s a fun language/framework I look forward to using it more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Python. Worked with Django for a couple years on Readability.
                    Adore it’s syntax and packages. Will use it to <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/timebomb">build tools</a>
                    to aid in laziness.

        I staked my claim on this piece of Internet property in 2006. Since then
        I’ve maintained this site as my portfolio and blog. You can access the source
        code for it <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com">here</a>.
        If you’re interested in that sort of thing.

        This is the fifth iteration. Below are the previous versions.
        They are a testament to how much I’ve grown personally and how high the
        bar has been raised for quality in Web Design.
