<p class="entry-intro">
  Sass has been my go-to for styling for years. It's been taken much burden off writing and organizing styles. In the last few years alternatives have shown up on the scene. Recently I've been wanting to try out a new styling setup using just CSS with the aid of PostCSS to fill Sass's big shoes.
</p>

<p>
  The first thing I did was take an inventory of what Sass features I was using.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>imports</li>
  <li>underscore naming convention</li>
  <li>$ - variables</li>
  <li>nesting</li>
  <li>mixins</li>
  <li>functions</li>
  <li>extends (maybe I shouldn't use this)</li>
  <li>placeholder classes</li>
  <li>color functions (darken, lighten, rgba with hex and variable values)</li>
  <li>compression</li>
</ul>
