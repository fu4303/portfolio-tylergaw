<p class="entry-intro">
  I recently had a need to be able to control the time of <code>audio</code>
  elements via a URL query string. I whipped up a bit of JavaScript to handle it.
  There’s a demo <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/media-seek-from-url/">here</a> and
  the source is <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/media-seek-from-url">on GitHub</a>.
  I had fun figuring it out and thought maybe you’d enjoy reading about it.
  The following are details about why I needed it and the code I wrote.
</p>
<p>
  As with most projects, this one started with a problem that needed fixin’ The
  site this was for had a listing of audio tracks. Each list item included; the <code>audio</code>
  element, a title/link to the page for that track and a short description.
  Some of list items had additional links to the track’s page in the description.
</p>
<p>
  With this setup, the links to the track pages were causing the problem. Here’s
  what was happening; Users were pressing play on one of the tracks in the list.
  They would then click on one of the track’s links. That would take them away
  from the listing to that track’s page. The navigation would cause them to
  lose their place in the track they were listening to. The tracks were podcasts that
  ran from 45 to 70 minutes in length so losing your spot at 33 minutes and 45 seconds was annoying.
</p>
<p>
  This is where controlling the time of the <code>audio</code> element came into play.
  Clicking on a link should take the user to the track’s page and
  the track should resume playing where they left off.
</p>
<h2>Writing The Thing</h2>
<p>
  YouTube does this style of jumping around in a video via the URL. I think
  the query string style they use works well, so I took my cues from them. I would
  have URLs like:<br> <code>http://site.com/tracks/track-name?t=1h22m35s</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Two quick things about the following code examples and descriptions:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    I wrote the original code for a specific project. The code I’ll be showing
    here is a modified version of that project’s code. The biggest difference
    is that there are no links to separate pages. I left that out because I
    felt like the main idea is not the navigation between pages.
  </li>
  <li>
    The example only shows <code>audio</code> elements. The some code
    can be used with the <code>video</code> element because both use the same
    HTML media api.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  To get going, I didn’t want to get bogged down in run-of-the-mill stuff. I wanted something new.
  I knew that changing an <code>href</code> value of an <code>a</code> on click wouldn’t be challenging,
  so I started in the middle with something I didn’t know how to do.
  I started with parsing the query string I’d use–(ex., <code>?t=1h32m27s</code>)–that
  I would just type into the URL bar to get a usable time value.
</p>
<p>
  On page load, I’m running a function called <code>seekIfNeeded</code>. This
  function checks the <code>window.location.search</code> for the presense of
  the string “t=”. This will determine if we need to bother trying to parse
  a time from the URL. This check is by no means fool-proof, but for my purposes
  it gets the job done.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function seekIfNeeded () {
  var q = window.location.search;

  if (q.indexOf('t=') > -1) {
    // Do parsing stuff
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  After we’ve determined that we do need to parse a time we do a bit of setup,
  prepare, the audio element, and if a condition is met start parsing the query
  string into a time.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function seekIfNeeded () {
  var q = window.location.search;

  if (q.indexOf('t=') > -1) {
    // Store the "1h34m27s" portion of the query string
    var timeString = q.split('=')[1],

      // Store a reference to the audo element with an id of "media"
      media = document.getElementById('media'),

      // Have we updated the time of the media element from the URL before?
      seekedFromURL = false;

    // We can only interact with audio elements when they are ready.
    // Listen for the "canplay" event to know when that is.
    media.addEventListener('canplay', function () {

      // The "canplay" event is triggered every time the audio element
      // is able to play. We only want to change the currentTime of
      // the audio the first time this event fires.
      if (!seekedFromURL) {

        // The currentTime property seeks to a value of seconds in
        // the media element.
        media.currentTime = secondsFromTimeParts(partsFromTimeString(timeString));

        // We've done the seeking, don't do this again.
        seekedFromURL = true;
      }
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Most of that code is boilerplate. Things get interesting with the line that sets
  <code>media.currentTime</code>. It’s being set to the value of a function–
  <code>secondsFromTimeParts</code>–that is being passed the value of another
  function–<code>partsFromTimeString</code>.
</p>
<p>
  So many functions right? I tend to take a functional approach with my JavaScript
  when applicable. I’m not always sure what is pure functional programming, but
  I get a lot of milage out of a lot of small functions that; take a value, do
  one or more small things with that value, and then return a new value without
  effecting the initial value or other items outside of the functions. Maybe I
  need to say “function” once more here for good measure?
</p>
<p>
  Let’s break down that line of code from the inside out. First <code>timeString</code>
  is a string like; “1h32m23s” or “15m10s” or “12s”. Any combination of hours,
  minutes, and seconds. Even though humans can figure out that the string represents time, the <code>audio</code>
  element isn’t going to understand it. The string is passed to <code>partsFromTimeString</code>.
  That function converts the string into an object of key/value pairs where the
  keys represent a part of the time and the values the amount of time for each part.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function partsFromTimeString (str) {
  var parts = {h: 0, m: 0, s: 0};

  // Breaks the string into an array like ["1h", "32m", "6s"]
  //
  // Wrapping in a try to avoid an error in case someone gives the 't='
  // query string with no time. It'll just default to zero without it.
  try {
    str.match(/[0-9]+[hms]+/g).forEach(function (val) {

      // Creates an array with two elements, the time and part key like ["32", "m"]
      var part = val.match(/[hms]+|[0-9]+/g);
      parts[part[1]] = parseInt(part[0], 10);
    });
  }
  catch (e) {}

  return parts;
}
</pre></code>


<!-- <p>
    For this project I was working specifically with the <code>audio</code> element,
    but all of the code can be used with the <code>video</code> element as well.
