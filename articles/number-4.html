              For the fourth time I've taken on the task of designing my personal site. This is never an easy process and rarely happens quickly. This time was definitely not an exception.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first PSD I have titled "tylergaw2011-01.psd" was created on November 7, 2010. I've been working on this redesign for at least one year, one month and 26 days. I also have some initial sketches that I'm pretty sure I did a week or so before that first PSD, so I've worked on the design for more like year and two months. That's a pretty damn long time. The main reason it took so long is that I gave myself permission to slow down. I wanted to iterate on the design until I felt confident in it. I didn't want to just dole something out that I would be disgusted with again in 6 months.
            </p>
            <p>
              I going to give a walk-through of the design process I went through to get from my initial sketches to a pretty weak first concept through two more not-quite-as-bad concepts to the design that is live today.
            </p>
            <h2>First sketches and ideas</h2>
            <p>
              The first concept I had in mind was a kind of Monty Python/collage type monstrosity. I envisioned large, ornate typography, flying fish, odd feet and all other types of campy goodness. I did a couple of quick sketches to start organizing my thoughts and finding out if the concept had legs.

          	<p>
          	  Legs it did not have. I could tell quickly that trying to pull off this design was going to lead me down a path of gimmicks and over-doing-it. I quickly abandoned ship.
