              For the fourth time I've taken on the task of designing my personal site. This is never an easy process and rarely happens quickly. This time was definitely not an exception.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first PSD I have titled "tylergaw2011-01.psd" was created on November 7, 2010. I've been working on this redesign for at least one year, one month and 26 days. I also have some initial sketches that I'm pretty sure I did a week or so before that first PSD, so I've worked on the design for more like year and two months. That's a pretty damn long time. The main reason it took so long is that I gave myself permission to slow down. I wanted to iterate on the design until I felt confident in it. I didn't want to just dole something out that I would be disgusted with again in 6 months.
            </p>
            <p>
              I going to give a walk-through of the design process I went through to get from my initial sketches to a pretty weak first concept through two more not-quite-as-bad concepts to the design that is live today.
            </p>
            <h2>Initial idea and sketches</h2>
            <p>
              The first concept I had in mind was a kind of Monty Python/collage weird type of thing. I envisioned large, ornate typography, flying fish, balloons, odd feet and all other types of campy goodness. I did a couple of quick sketches to start organizing my thoughts and finding out if the concept had legs.

          	</figure>
          	<p>
          	  Legs it did not have. I could tell quickly that trying to pull off this design was going to lead me down a path of gimmicks and over-doing-it. I quickly abandoned ship.
          	</p>
          	<p>
          	  The second concept I had carried me through one partial design, two near complete and the third and final. I wanted the design to have a kind of screen-printed poster look. I code see type that had ink bleeds and runovers in some of the corners. By this time I jumped into Photoshop and just started throwing stuff together. I came up with something, but it felt too forced. I was really hanging on to a kind of punk show flyer style that just wasn't carrying the site in a good direction. Again, I could see that going down this path was going to produce a design that would quickly become stale.

          	</figure>
          	<p>
          	  Even though the first attempts at a design were throw-away, it really helped push the direction for the following designs. I took the parts that were working and continued with them in a different direction.
          	</p>
          	<p>
          	  I started the second design attempt, still using the idea of a screen printed posted, but this time screen print on something like a burlap sack or cheesecloth. This one felt like it was really going to work. I was using different colors that I don't use often. I got to do a lot of experimenting with making that burlap/cheesecloth texture.

          	</figure>
          	<p>
          	  I jumped into the browser quickly with this concept. I wanted to get HTML and CSS laid down to start playing with the type and flexible grids. It's a given these days that the design would be responsive, seems odd to think of doing a fixed width anything. It progressed really far. By getting into the browser I was able to quickly see what was working and where tweaks were needed. I kept a pretty tight browser, back to Photoshop, back to browser loop going for a while.
