            The <a href="http://youtu.be/ZRPpCqXYoos">opening titles</a> to the
            show True Detective are beautiful. CSS has most of the building
            blocks necessary to create a similar title sequence. I tried my
            hand it and came up with interesting results. Here's the
            <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/css-true-titles/">demo</a> and the
            <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/css-true-titles">source code</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing I have to do is issue the disclaimer. This is an
            experimental project. Things will most likely go wrong when you view
            it. I'm trying to make the browser do things that it really doesn't
            want to. Also, due to limited suppport of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-masking-1">CSS masking</a>
            you'll only see the full effect in Chrome and possibly Mobile Safari.
            The animations will work in other browsers, but things will look strange.
        </p>
        <h2>The Masking</h2>
        <p>
            There's a whole lot going on in each shot of the TD titles. You should
            read the write up about it on <a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/true-detective/">Art of the Title</a>.
            The main effect that I wanted to recreate was the use of human silhouettes
            to mask shots. They use video clips for the masks and the content being
            masked, but I stuck with still images to keep things a little easier.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="/articles/assets/post-image-true-titles-mask-example.jpg"
                alt="">
            <figcaption>
                An example of using a person to mask footage in the True Detective titles
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            I'm accomplishing masking using the CSS <code>mask</code>
            property. As I mentioned above, it has limited support. I'm going
            to break down the first title card to explain how the masking is
            implemented.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="/articles/assets/post-image-true-titles-opener-card.jpg"
                alt="">
            <figcaption>
                A still of the first title card.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Each title card is an <code>li</code> element. They contain some base
            styles like width, height, positioning, etc. Within each <code>li</code>
            is markup specific to that card. Below is the markup for images of the
            opening card.
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;div class="composition animated"&gt;
  &lt;div class="town animated">&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="human">&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
            The containing <code>div</code> element with the class of "composition"
            houses all the images. I'm using a containing element here so I can move
            and scale the "human" and the "town" together, while still being able
            to move and scale each independently. I'm also applying the mask
            to the composition element. The "human" and "town" elements have background
            images applied to them.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://lab.tylergaw.com/css-true-titles/img/opener-human.png"
                alt="">
            <figcaption>
                The partially transparent human image, which doubles as the mask
                for the opening card.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://lab.tylergaw.com/css-true-titles/img/opener-town.png"
                alt="">
            <figcaption>
                The background image for the town element.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            I want to be able to move the "town" element. If I applied the mask
            to that element it would move with it and would not line up properly
            with the human image. I needed to apply the mask to an element above it.
            Since CSS mask are only concerned with the opaque and transparent
            portions of an image, I can reuse the human image as the mask for the
            "composition" element using the CSS below.
        </p>
        <pre><code>.opener .composition {
  ...
  -webkit-mask: url("opener-human.png") top left/cover no-repeat;
  mask: url("opener-human.png") top left/cover no-repeat;
}</code></pre>

        <h2>The Animations</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted constant motion in each shot. The motion is mostly sublte,
            slow change.
        </p>
