            Fonts have always felt like a black box to me. The thought of creating
            a new one has seemed like a task reserved for a select few with decades
            of training and a deep knowledge of the history
            of typography. Certainly not me. I've shown myself that that is not
            entirely true. <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/slenderman">Slenderman</a>
            is my first typeface. I made to fit
            the needs of a project I'm working on, and of course, for fun.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Did I Do This?</h2>
        <p>
            I made this font to scratch an itch. Specifically, I started a small
            project that called for hand drawn type. I could have gone the route
            of using images, but that just doesn't feel right on the Web these days.
            I want my web type to be scaleable and maintainable. Using images for
            type is neither of those. It was clear that I'd need to either find an
            existing font that fit the style I wanted, or roll my own.
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't look around for existing fonts that fit. I immediately jumped
            to creating my own. The project is a personal one so there's no real
            time limit. When I have that choice I love to let projects expand to
            as many different areas as they need to. This same project also led
            me down the path of building <a href="http://tylergaw.com/articles/webvtt-cuemarker">another small tool</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>What Did I Do?</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://glyphsapp.com/glyphs-mini/">Glyphs Mini</a>. Made me
            realized that I could actually make a font. It's an affordable, well-built
            piece of software that does exactely what I needed.
        </p>
        <h2>What Did I Learn?</h2>
        <p>
            Slenderman does not make me a typography by any means. It did open up
            the possibilty though. Working on it has given me and ever greater
            appreciation for the skill and patience that is required to create the
            beautiful type that we use and often take for granted.
