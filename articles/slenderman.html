            Fonts have always felt like a black box to me. The thought of creating
            a new one seemed like a task reserved for a select few with decades
            of experience, a deep knowledge of typography, and cumbersome,
            expensive software. Not me, I thought. I proved myself wrong by
            making my first font,
            <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/slenderman">Slenderman</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Made to Scratch an Itch</h2>
        <p>
            I'm working on a small design project that felt like it needed hand drawn type.
            I could have gone the route of using images, but
            that just doesn't feel right on the Web these days.
            I want my web type to be scalable and maintainable. Using images for
            type is neither of those. It was clear that I'd need to either find an
            existing font that fit the style I wanted, or roll my own.
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't look around for existing fonts that fit. I jumped straight
            to creating my own. The project is a personal one so there’s no
            time limit. When I have that choice I love to let projects expand to
            as many different areas as they need to. This same project also led
            me down the path of building <a href="http://tylergaw.com/articles/webvtt-cuemarker">another small tool</a>
            for working with HTML video subtitles.
        </p>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
            I knew how I wanted the capital letters to look from the start. I
            started by just drawing them out on paper. My first thought for the
            lowercase letters was to make them not match the style of the caps,
            but to be a complement to them. I though a cursive handwriting style
            would be a nice contrast to the tall, skinny caps.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            After drawing the letters, I scanned them and used Illustrator's
            Live Trace to convert them to vectors. The cursive lowercase letters didn't
            convert well. They lost a lot of detail, and just kind of turned
            into muck. It was clear they weren't going to work out so I ditched them.

        </p>
        <p>
            I went back to the pen and paper and drew a new set of lowercase
            letters as well as the numbers, punctuation, and assorted symbols.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Numbers, punctuation, symbols, and two sets of lowercase letter sketches</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            With all the characters drawn, scanned, and converted to vector the next
            step was to start refining them. All the charaters needed to have similar
            stroke weights, similar widths and heights, and a handful of other
            defining characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started with the capital letters. They converted to vector really well.
            So for them I mostly just needed to make sure each letter was the
            correct width and height. I also needed to remove extra, uneeded
            points that Live Trace had added during conversion.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            While I was refining each capital letter, I was bringing each into
            <a href="http://glyphsapp.com/glyphs-mini/">Glyphs Mini</a>. It allows
            vectors to be pasted in from Illustrator. Once the vector is in Glyphs
            I could set the position, spacing, and kerning. In Glyphs you can
            also type out any character in the edit tab so you can get a feel
            for how each one interacts with the others.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            The refining process for the lowercase letters took a lot more work.
            For each of the 26 letters, I needed to make the strokes narrower,
            and for a lot of them completely change the shape from what I had
            drawn. This involved manually moving each point that made up the the
            letter. It felt a lot like the original vectors were big chunks of
            rough granite that I was chiseling down into their final forms.
            As you can imagine, it's a tedious process.
        </p>
        <p>
            I followed the same process for the punctuation, numbers, and symbols.
            While I was refining the numbers, I did get a little overzealous. I
            ended up chipping away a bit too much off each one, leaving them very
            skinny. When they were next to other characters it looked like they
            were from a different family. This required me to go back and make
            each number a bit heavier. Lesson learned; compare each character to
            as many others as you can while you're tweaking the vectors.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            Glyphs Mini allows for exporting of an .otf. While I was adding characters
            I wanted to get a better feel for how they were working. I would export
            the font, install it and then open up a test Photoshop document. Seeing
            full sentences and different combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols
            is really key to determining if things are working. You can better
            see any issues with spacing and sizing. You can pick out pairs of
            characters that could use attention to kerning.

        <h2>Detail of a “Gotcha”</h2>

        <h2>Slenderman is Open Source</h2>

        <h2>What Did I Learn?</h2>
        <p>
            Slenderman does not make me a typography by any means. It did open up
            the possibilty though. Working on it has given me and ever greater
            appreciation for the skill and patience that is required to create the
            beautiful type that we use and often take for granted.
