            <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper">Paper</a> is an excellent
            product. Like all great products, it not only does a thing well, it
            also makes you want to do that thing more. Paper makes me want to
            draw more. After drawing with Paper for a couple weeks, I wanted a
            quick way to share my drawings from Paper to the Web. I built
            <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/papersaver">Papersaver</a> to
            allow me to do that.

        <h2>In Dependence</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://madewithpaper.fiftythree.com/">Made with Paper</a>
            is a cool showcase of what people are drawing with Paper. I went to
            submit one of my goofy characters to it and saw that they ask for an
            attribution link. They suggest–and most submissions are hosted on–Tumblr.
            Twitter and Facebook are also mentioned as hosting choices. I’m not
            a fan of that. I want the canonical location of my drawings to be on
            a server that I control. This is my natural tendency, but I was also
            inspired by <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/6620/">Jeremy</a>
            and <a href="http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/12/homesteading-2014/">Frank’s</a>
            articles on the topic of pushing ourselves to take more control over
            our digital artifacts by self-hosting.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point it was clear that I had a fun side project in front of
            me. I had a few days off work for the holidays, so I started letting
            my brain run wild with possibilities. My plan was to build some type
            of site where I could publish my drawings and at the same time dig
            into technologies that were new to me.
        </p>
        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <p>
            I generally start a new project out with a few bullet points for
            what I want, what I don’t, technologies I’ll use, etc. These points
            don’t always make it into the final project and some are just questions
            to think about during the process. Here’s a few I jotted down for
            Papersaver:
        </p>
        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Publish images from Paper to my personal Web site</li>
            <li>Do not rely on third-party platforms for storage</li>
            <li>“In Dependence”</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Static HTML site</li>
            <li>Displays a list of images (maybe thumbnails + click to enlarge)</li>
            <li>Git repo backed up to Github</li>
            <li>Different input methods: email, Twitter, direct to repo</li>
            <li>generate(): image creation, HTML generation, Git commit, publish</li>
            <li>How can others use this?</li>
            <li>Permalinks to each item</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            At this point I’ll also jot down some pseudo-code to start thinking
            about core functions of what I’ll be building. In this case I wanted
            to visualize what the main method of saving a Paper would look like:
        </p>
        <pre><code>newPaper() // takes img
  // contents/papers/Date.getTime()
  // &quot; &quot;/index.md
  // date: D.getTime()
  // template: paper.html
  // image_path: tylergaw-paper-{date}.jpg
  // save img: image_path.jpg</code></pre>

        <h2>Getting Rolling</h2>
        <p>
            After a few hours of writing down goals and researching similar
            projects I had a plan for what I would build and the tools I would
            use to build it. I wanted to be able to publish drawings directly
            from the Paper app. Paper allows drawings to be shared to Tumblr,
            Facebook, Twitter, Camera Roll, and Email. The first three were out
            since they’re third-parties. I entertained the idea of using a
            combination of export to cameral roll and Dropbox to publish, but
            went away from it because it didn’t feel as flexible as it should be.
            I’d be going the route of publishing by email.
        </p>
        <p>Here’s the process for using Papersaver:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Draw in Paper
            </li>
            <li>
                Email each drawing to a dedicated email address
            </li>
            <li>
                A Node.js <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/papersaver/blob/master/papersaver-mail-listener.js">script</a>
                would listen for new email at that address
            </li>
            <li>
                When a new email arrives, that script would grab the attached
                image and hand it off to
                <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/papersaver/blob/master/papersaver.js">Papersaver.js</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Papersaver.js will create the necessary directories and files
                that static site generator <a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">Wintersmith</a>
                needs
            </li>
            <li>
                Wintersmith would then regenerate the site with the new drawings
            </li>
            <li>
                The newly added and created files would be commited to the Git
                repo and those commits would be pushed to the remote repo at Github
            </li>
            <li>
                The drawings would then be available at <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/papers">http://lab.tylergaw.com/papers</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
