            Fonts have always felt like a black box to me. The thought of creating
            a new one seemed like a task reserved for a select few with decades
            of experience, a deep knowledge of typography, and cumbersome,
            expensive software. Not me, I thought. I proved myself wrong by
            making my first font,
            <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/papers">my papers</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
            While I was refining each capital letter, I was bringing each into
            <a href="http://glyphsapp.com/glyphs-mini/">Glyphs Mini</a>, my font
            editor of choice. It allows vectors to be pasted in from Illustrator.
            Once the vector is in Glyphs I could set the position and spacing.
            Glyphs also allows characters to be typed out in
            the edit tab to get a real feel for how each one interacts
            with the others. This allows for creating kerning pairs of characters.
